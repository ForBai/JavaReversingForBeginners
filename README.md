# Java Reverse Engineering For Beginners

This repository is a beginner's guide to reverse engineering in Java. It contains a variety of examples and exercises to help you understand and practice the concepts of reverse engineering.

## Building the Project

This project uses the Gradle build system. To build the project, follow these steps:

1. Ensure you have Gradle installed on your system. If not, you can download it from the [official Gradle website](https://gradle.org/install/).
2. Open a terminal and navigate to the root directory of the project.
3. Run the following command to build the project:

```bash
gradle build
```

This will compile the source code and run the tests. If the build is successful, the compiled classes will be placed in the `build/classes` directory, and a JAR file will be created in the `build/libs` directory.
